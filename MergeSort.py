Here's a simple explanation of **Merge Sort** with Python code:

### How Merge Sort works:
1. **Divide:** The array is divided into two halves repeatedly until each sub-array contains only one element (base case).
2. **Conquer:** Recursively sort the sub-arrays.
3. **Combine:** Merge the sorted sub-arrays to produce the final sorted array.

### Python Code for Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        # Find the middle point
        mid = len(arr) // 2

        # Dividing the array elements into 2 halves
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        # Recursively sort the two halves
        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        # Initial indexes for left, right, and merged sub-arrays
        i = j = k = 0

        # Merge the two halves back together
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # Check if any element is left in the left half
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        # Check if any element is left in the right half
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

# Example usage
arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
merge_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

### Explanation:
- **Base case:** If the array has one or zero elements, it's already sorted.
- **Recursive splitting:** The array is split into left and right halves.
- **Merging process:** The sorted halves are merged back together by comparing the elements.

### Output:
```
Sorted array: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
```
